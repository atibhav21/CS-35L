GNU/Linux
- Open Source Operating System
	- Kernel: core of operating system
		- communication between software and hardware
		- allocates time and memory to programs
	- Shell: Interface between the user and the kernel
		- command line interface
	- Programs

Ubuntu and Red Hat

Use SEAS Server - best option

Interacting with Computers: History

1. Switches and Lights
2. Batch Processing
3. Teletype - CLI (Command Line Interface)
4. GUI

Everything is either a process or a file:

Process: an executing program identified by PID
File: collection of data
	A document
	Text of program written in high level language
	Executable
	Directory
	Devices

Linux File System Layout
Tree structured hierarchy
Root (/)
	
Absolute Path always has the '/' at the beginning
Relative Path does not have the root character at the beginning

pwd: Print working directory
cd: Change directory
	~ Home Directory
	. current Directory
	/ root directory or directory separator
	.. parent directory

Dealing with files
	mv: move/rename a file
	cp: copy a file
	rm remove a file
	 	-r remove directories and their contents recursively
	mkdir make a directory
	rmdir remove an empty directory
	ls: list contents of a directory
		-d: list only directories
		-a: list all files including hidden ones
		-l: show long listing including permission info
		-s: show size of each file in blocks

Changing file attributes
ln: create a link
	- Hard links: point to physical data
	- Soft links aka symbolic links (-s): point to a file

touch: update access & modification time to current time 
	- touch filename
	- touch -t 201101311759.30 filename

Soft Link

r: readable
w: writeable
x: executable

chmod u+r filename

Finding 

-type type of a file
-perm permission of a file
-name name of a file
-user owner of file
-maxdepth how many levels to search

find / -name filename -user atibhav

File name matching
?: match any single character in a filename
	eg. find / -name filen?me

man
Extensive documentation that comes preinstalled
eg. 
	man <command_name>
	man section command_name
	Hit q to get out of man page

whatis <command_name>
whereis <command_name>

Special Permissions
Sticky Bit: o+t 
	Used for shared directories. Locks file within directory from being modified by people other than the owner of the files within it even if they have write permissions

setuid, setgid (u+s, g+s)
- set user ID upon execution
- Run an executable with the permissions of the executable’s owner or group

Regular Expression
Notation to search for a pattern of text

grep ‘.’ - Matches any character except NUL or possibly New line character
grep ‘e*’ - Matches 


LAB 4

Do the Git Tutorial before starting the assignment
Set up X11 forwarding on using tutorial on Josh’s website

Check Out - Download a working copy of the software to work on it
Check In - Commit (write the change)

Blobs - Sequence of bytes
Trees - Groups of Blobs/trees

Commit - Refers to a particular "git commit", contains all information about the commit

CLI 
git checkout ... - to checkout a project
