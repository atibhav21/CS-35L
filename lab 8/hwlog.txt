scp srt.tgz atibhav@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu:~/35L/lab8
to copy the .tgz file to the SEASNet server

tar -xvzf srt.tgz
To extract the contents of srt.tgz

gimp baseline.ppm 
To view the image before making a change

After modifying main.c

ran
make clean check > make-log.txt

real	0m48.237s

To check that 1-test.ppm and baseline.ppm were identical, I ran the command
diff -u baseline.ppm 1-test.ppm > diffImage.txt

diffImage.txt was an empty file as we wanted.
