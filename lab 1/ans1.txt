1. man -K define I used the man man hint given on the webpage to find the -K
	 which lets us search for a string in all the commands

2.
	whereis cp 
	whereis wc
	whereis command was given in the slides so it was easy running these 
	commands. I chose where is because the question is worded exactly like 
	“Where are the cp and wc programs located”

3. find /usr/bin -type f -name ?.exe
	I searched in /usr/bin because that is what we were told in class. I used 
	-type f since we are looking for a file. I used -name ?.exe because an 
	executable with just one character would be name something like “a.exe” or 
	“b.exe” etc. Hence the ? does the job here.

4. 	etc/alternatives/emacs
	I used readlink /usr/bin/emacs for this problem since we have to read 
	where the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs points to. 

5. 	g+s: set group ID on execution  o-x: remove permission of others to 
	execute the file This was Covered in the slides in my lab section and 
	was pretty straight-forward.

6. 	-mtime
	I used man find to find a suitable option which helps us find all the 
	files modified in the past n days

7. 	find . -mtime -21
 	I struggled with this problem since I was using -mtime 21 instead of 
 	-mtime -21. However, after seeing a couple of examples I realized what I 
 	was doing wrong. 

8. 	find /usr/bin -type l
	I found the -type l option in the man page of find. I search in the 
	/usr/bin directory because that is where the find command is.
	Output produced: (condensed)
	/usr/bin/hp-query 
	/usr/bin/rmail
	/usr/bin/scrollkeeper-config

9.	find -type f | sort | head -n 1
	I found the sort option after some help from my TA Josh. I found the -n 1 
	by reading the man page of find. What -n 1 does is it only prints the 
	first output line produced from the command. 
	Output: ./acroread/bin/acroread

10. locale writes information about the argument passed to it. IF no argument 
	is passed to locale, then it summarizes the current environment defined by
	the LC_* environment variables

11. sort-columns, sort-fields, sort-lines, sort-numeric-fields, sort-pages, 
	sort-paragraphs, sort-regexp-fields
	I found this by typing M-x sort Enter Enter. This showed the possible 
	completions for the M-x sort- command, which lead to this answer. 
12. C-M
	C-M-a: move the cursor One function backward
	C-M-b: move the cursor one expression backward
	C-M-c: exit a recursive edit
	C-M-d: no command
	C-M-e: move the cursor one function forward
	C-M-f: move the cursor one expression forward
	C-M-g: no command
	C-M-h: mark a function

13.	C-g stops a command that is taking too long to execute. It can also be 
	used to remove the numeric argument of a command or remove the Escape 
	Key (ESC) 		from the command buffer. 

14. Yank function is used to paste any text that has been either killed (cut)
	before or has been copied before

15. When I did this it generated around ~5000 lines. What I did was I changed 
my directory to /usr/bin. Then I executed the command ls -l >~/Desktop/lsl.txt
This created a file on the desktop with the result of the command. Then I went 
into emacs and created a new buffer on the desktop and copied the result from
tired command using C-x o (to switch buffers) C-x h (to Select all the lines) 
M-w (to copy the lines) and C-y (to paste the lines). After executing all these 
commands I executed diff -u lsl.txt emacdired.txt >result.diff. This result.diff
had around 5000 lines of difference.
