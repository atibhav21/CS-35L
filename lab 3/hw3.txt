Q1
The patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because the default 
had to be changed from the ISO format to the POSIX format. It was necessary 
to remove that line because the default should not be ISO in case a 
translation is available.

Q2
It could be a possible source of bugs in parsing output from the ls command. 
This would introduce problems in non-English speaking countries because the 
date format would be different and would not be understandable to the people.

Q3
Running the randline.py script with an empty file like /dev/null produces a 
"list index out of range" exception since the script tries to access a random
 line number in an empty file, which throws an IndexError exception. However, 
 the script does not have a catch block for this kind of exception.

Q4
When I run the command with python3 instead of just python, I get a 
SyntaxError:invalid syntax on the line "except IOError as (errno, strerror):""
because the format in python3 is "except IOError as err:"
