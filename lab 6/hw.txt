If the other teams are observing the bytes flowing across the network, 
they will not be able to decode the message. Once the network is setup, 
decrypting the bytes flowing across is very hard. Hence, the network will 
still be secure

a. 
The network will still be secure. Even after tapping the keyboard, the 
other teams will have no way of being able to find out the key. If the system
were password based, then the system wouldn't be secure but since the key
generated is not typed on they keyboard, there is no way for the other teams
to tap the network.

b. 
If the other team had access to my boot USB, they could access my filesystem
if the boot CD stores files. However, once I disconnect, all the files would 
be reset and all data would be lost.

2. 
gpg--verify won't confirm the creator of the file because it is possible for 
someone to have intercepted the initial connection and modified the encryption
such that it showed them as the sender. The way to get around this is to have 
a 3rd party verification system that contains the users public key and their 
name, email address and other such potential information that could verify 
the actual creator of the encrypted file
