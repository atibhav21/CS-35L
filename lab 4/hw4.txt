git checkout v3.0 -b quote
I ran this command to make a new unmodified branch.

3. patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt
I ran this command to apply the patch file to this unmodified code to make it
work properly. I used the -p1 option to ignore everything before the first 
slash in the patch file, since the src folders in the patch and this folder 
are the same.
