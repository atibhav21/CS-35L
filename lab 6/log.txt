Installation steps
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
sudo apt-get install emacs
I ran these commands to set up the lab. 

Server-Steps

ssh-keygen
To generate a key for the user

sudo useradd -d /home/devin -m devin
Create an accound for the user

sudo passwd devin
I ran this command to make a password for the user, even though the 
client never uses the password

cd /home/devin
sudo mkdir .ssh
mkdir test
We made this test directory to check if actual connection was established

sudo chown -R devin .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh
Modify user permissions


emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Set the password authentication option to no

Client Steps

ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i atibhav@10.97.85.180
ssh-add
I ran these two commands to generate a key and copy it to the server.

ssh atibhav@10.97.85.180

Automatically logged in.
Ran an ls command to check if test folder is actually present

It showed the test directory.
Hence, actual connection was established

ssh -X atibhav@10.97.85.180
firefox
This opened a GUI for the firefox web browser.
